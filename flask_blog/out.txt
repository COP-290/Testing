In that object I am using a ReaderWriterLock to lock one property that represents the message that I want displayed on the form that the child thread creates.

I am using it to show a new div with a list gathered from a database when a button is pressed.  The problem is the button needs to do a postback to get this list as I don\'t want to make the call to the database unless it\'s needed.  The postback however stops the animation mid flow and resets it.  The button is within an update panel.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally I would want the animation to start once the postback is complete and the list has been gathered.

I’m still get some animation stutter.  The animation starts to play before the postback and then plays properly after postback.  Using the <code>onclkBehavior.pause()</code> has no effect.  I can get around this by setting the <code>AnimationExtender.Enabled = false</code> and setting it to true in the buttons postback event.  This however works only once as now the AnimationExtender is enabled again.  I have also tried disabling the <code>AnimationExtender</code> via javascript but this has no effect.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way of playing the animations only via javascript calls?  I need to decouple the automatic link to the \nbuttons click event so I can control when the animation is fired.</p>\n\n<p>Hope that makes sense.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n\n<p>DG</p>\n\''), ["'c#'", "'animationextender'"]], [(51700, 5363, datetime.datetime(2023, 4, 4, 9, 42, 26), 0, "'Property default values using Properties.Settings.Default'", '\'<p>I am using .Net 2 and the normal way to store my settings.

I think I could get used to it but I'm wondering if Apple wouldn't be better off with Eclipse. Before I found the setting where all the windows are stuck together I hated it, now I can tolerate it.</p></li>\n<li><p>iPhone SDK: strange indeed. I understand Apple's desire to control their environment but in this day and age it just seems a little sleazy and they are missing out on so much by destroying developer goodwill.</p></li>\n<li><p>Objective-C: I've known about it for years but never even took a look at it. The syntax is off-putting but I'm actually very intrigued by the language. I think it's an interesting third leg between C++ and C#, both of which I like a lot. Is there any chance Obj-C will break out of the Mac sandbox due to the uptick in the popularity of Apple technology?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Curious to read your thoughts,</p>\n\n<p>Andrew</p>\n'"), ["'c#'", "'c++'", "'iphone'", "'objective-c'", "'development-environment'"]], [(104850, 12597, datetime.datetime(2023, 4, 4, 9, 42, 28), 163, "'C#: Test if string is a guid without throwing exceptions?'", '\'<p>I want to try to convert a string to a Guid, but I don\'t want to rely on catching exceptions (</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>for performance reasons - exceptions are expensive</li>\n<li>for usability reasons - the debugger pops up </li>\n<li>for design reasons - the expected is not exceptional</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In other words the code:</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static Boolean TryStrToGuid(String s, out Guid value)\n{\n    try\n    {\n        value = new Guid(s);\n        return true;\n    }\n    catch (FormatException)\n    {\n        value = Guid.Empty;\n        return false;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>is not suitable.</p>\n\n<p>I would try using RegEx, but since the guid can be parenthesis wrapped, brace wrapped, none wrapped, makes it hard. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, I thought certain Guid values are invalid(?)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Update 1</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/104850/c-test-if-string-is-a-guid-without-throwing-exceptions#137829">ChristianK</a> had a good idea to catch only <code>FormatException</code>, rather than all.
